        <h2>The Story</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="images/pink-blob.gif" alt="Pink Blob" class="wrapped-image-right">
            It's the year 3025. As a result of the 3022 uprising, our avian overlords (commonly referred to as the <em>Cloaca Collective</em>) have outlawed the use of soylent-powered machinery for our racing sports. We have been forced to blob-only racing.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the blob is our evolved state, it was once considered a great humiliation to be seen in our natural form. Now, however, an underground movement has risen up to embrace our blobbishness and to show the world, and the Cloaca Collective, what we are capable of.
        </p>

        <p>
            These underground spherical street-speeding radicals have named this new race:
        </p>

        <p class="formula-blob-title"><strong>Formula Blob</strong></p>

        <h2>What is Formula Blob?</h2>

        <p>
            Formula Blob is a drag race which pits two blobs against one another. The first blob to the finish line wins. The first racer to steal all the points from the other racer wins the match!
        </p>

        <p>
             <img src="images/blue-blob.gif" alt="Blue Blob" class="wrapped-image-left">
            Each blob has a certain amount of boost. Unfortunately, due to our lack of blob racing for the past two hundred years, we have lost the feel for boost. This means we never know when we'll run out and cause us to collapse mid-race.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, scientists have discovered that blobs with a slower disposition tend to have more natural boost and that boost is also more powerful than those blobs who have natural skills in speed. Even with this miraculous genetic leveling of the playing field, more speed still wins races more often than more boost ‚Äî most of the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is for the purpose of genetic fairness that the rounded racers have devised a way to make point stealing more equal. The fastest racers have more points to lose in a race, while the slower racers have a flat number.
        </p>

        <p>
            In other words, if you pick the racer with the higher risk, you have the best chance to win, but if you don't you'll lose more than your opponent will.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/blob-rotate.gif" alt="Rotating Blob" class="wrapped-image-right">
            <em>(Hey, Geoff here, creator of Formula Blob. I find that it is pretty fun to race with the slower racer and try to win the match as fast as I can in terms of number of races. But if you're finding the challenge more than you bargained for, definitely race with a faster blob‚Ä¶ just watch out for all the extra boost the slower racers have!)</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, both racers start with 500 points each. The first racer to reach 1000 or more points (by stealing points from the losing racer) wins the match!
        </p>

        <p>
            Good luck! Race hard! <strong>Blob out!</strong>
