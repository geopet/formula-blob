# June 4, 2025: Lights, Sound, and Grit – Race Day Polish!

Today’s update is all about bringing the thrill of race day to life in Blob Race! From the moment the countdown begins to the final dash across the finish line, the game now crackles with new sights, sounds, and a gritty sense of competition.

## Starting Lights and Countdown SFX
The race start is now a true spectacle! A set of classic starting lights has been added to the countdown sequence, with each light illuminating in sync with the timer. As the tension builds, new sound effects punctuate each stage of the countdown, culminating in a satisfying "go!" that launches the blobs into action. These changes make every race start feel dramatic and authentic.

## Track Visuals and Grit
The racing action now unfolds on a proper track, complete with new map assets and a helper function to draw the course. The track isn’t just a static background—it’s packed with visual grit and detail, making every race feel grounded and intense. The addition of track grit and improved finish screen UI further immerse players in the world of Blob Race.

## UI and Finish Screen Enhancements
The race finish screen has been revamped for clarity and excitement, with improved messaging and layout. Whether you win or lose, the results now feel more impactful and celebratory.

## Code Quality and Logging
Behind the scenes, logging has been turned off by default for a cleaner player experience, and the codebase has been refactored for better organization and maintainability.

With these updates, Blob Race delivers a more cinematic, competitive, and visually rich experience. The starting line has never felt so real—get ready, get set, and race on!
