# April 29, 2025: Blob Selection and Arrow UI

Today was all about adding personality and interactivity to Blob Race. We focused on blob selection and enhancing the arrow UI to make the game more engaging.

The highlight of the day was the implementation of a basic blob selection feature. Players can now choose their racer, with visual and audio feedback making the selection process more engaging. This feature adds a personal touch to the game, allowing players to connect with their chosen blob.

We also introduced movement, randomness, and selection highlights for the arrows in the UI. These enhancements make the interface more dynamic and visually appealing, ensuring that players have a seamless and enjoyable experience.

To complement these changes, we added sound effects for blob selection and the locked-in state. These audio cues enhance the overall experience, making the game more immersive and satisfying.

Balancing the visual and audio elements was a challenge, as we aimed to ensure they complement each other without overwhelming the player. Despite this, the dayâ€™s efforts have made Blob Race more interactive and exciting.
