<p>The latest updates to Blob Race, now officially renamed to <strong>Formula Blob</strong>, bring a host of improvements, focusing on gameplay polish and visual excitement. Here’s a breakdown of what’s new:</p>

<h2 id="countdown-enhancements">Countdown Enhancements</h2>

<p>The countdown phase has been transformed into a more dynamic and engaging experience.

To complement this, a new animation has been introduced, bringing visual excitement to the countdown sequence and setting the stage for the race ahead.</p>

<h2 id="boost-animation-and-refactor">Boost Animation and Refactor</h2>

<p>The boost animation system has undergone a significant overhaul, enhancing both its visual clarity and maintainability. A brand-new boost animation injects energy into the racing experience, making every boost feel impactful. Behind the scenes, the code has been refactored to include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw_racer</code> helper function, streamlining the process of rendering racers. Additionally, per-blob state has been centralized into a single table, improving organization and paving the way for future enhancements.</p>

<h2 id="audio-enhancements">Audio Enhancements</h2>

<p>The audio experience has also received attention, with new features designed to immerse players further into the world of Formula Blob. The addition of crowd and engine noise brings the racing environment to life, while the sharp squeal of tires during false starts provides immediate and satisfying feedback.

<p>The past week has been all about refining the core mechanics and player experience in Blob Race. With a focus on boost balance, improved logging, and UI clarity, the game now feels more responsive, fair, and fun to play.</p>

<h2 id="boost-balance-overhaul">Boost Balance Overhaul</h2>

<p>A major highlight is the complete overhaul of the boost bonus and strength calculation logic. The boost system is now simpler and more transparent: the bonus is always set as a direct function of the speed gap, and the strength calculation is streamlined for consistency. This not only makes the code easier to maintain but also ensures that races feel balanced and competitive, regardless of which blob you choose.</p>

<h2 id="debug-logging-improvements">Debug Logging Improvements</h2>

<p>To aid in development and future tuning, a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quick_log</code> table was introduced. This allows for easy, targeted debug output of key boost variables like scale and bonus. The logging system itself has been refactored for clarity, and logging is now off by default for a cleaner player experience.</p>

<h2 id="ui-and-scoring-display">UI and Scoring Display</h2>

<p>The race countdown and scoring UI have both received polish. The countdown sequence is now more visually engaging, and the scoring display during blob selection and after races is clearer, helping players understand the risk and reward of their choices at a glance.</p>

<h2 id="audio-and-quality-of-life">Audio and Quality of Life</h2>

<p>A new audio mute feature lets players toggle music on and off with a single button press, making the game more accessible in different play environments.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood</h2>

<p>Much of the recent work has focused on code quality: refactoring boost logic, consolidating logging, and improving the structure of player and opponent boost tables. These changes make the codebase more robust and ready for future features.</p>

<hr />

<p>With these updates, Blob Race continues to evolve into a more polished, strategic, and enjoyable experience.

<p>Today’s update is all about bringing the thrill of race day to life in Blob Race! From the moment the countdown begins to the final dash across the finish line, the game now crackles with new sights, sounds, and a gritty sense of competition.</p>

<h2 id="starting-lights-and-countdown-sfx">Starting Lights and Countdown SFX</h2>
<p>The race start is now a true spectacle! A set of classic starting lights has been added to the countdown sequence, with each light illuminating in sync with the timer. As the tension builds, new sound effects punctuate each stage of the countdown, culminating in a satisfying “go!” that launches the blobs into action.

<p>Today’s development session was a blast, bringing fresh energy and polish to Blob Race! With a brand new dynamic music system and a crucial scoring bug fix, the game now feels more alive and fair than ever. These changes not only enhance the atmosphere but also ensure every race is as thrilling and rewarding as it should be.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-music-system">Dynamic Music System</h2>
<p>A major highlight is the new dynamic music system. Blob Race now changes background music based on the current game state: a welcoming tune plays on the start screen, while a different track sets the mood during blob selection. This is managed by the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">music_player</code> function, which ensures smooth transitions and prevents unnecessary restarts. The result is a more immersive and responsive audio experience that matches the game’s pacing and excitement.</p>

<h2 id="bug-fix-scoring-consistency">Bug Fix: Scoring Consistency</h2>
<p>During this session, a subtle bug in the scoring logic was also addressed. The calculation of the absolute value for the moneyline in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update_scoring</code> function is now performed after the player’s moneyline is determined, ensuring the correct value is always used for both underdog and favorite scenarios. This fix guarantees that the risk/reward system works as intended, providing fair and accurate results for every race outcome.</p>

<h2 id="code-quality-and-maintenance">Code Quality and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Alongside these features, the codebase saw minor cleanups and improved organization, especially around initialization and state management. These changes lay the groundwork for future enhancements and make the project easier to maintain.</p>

<p>With these updates and fixes, Blob Race continues to grow in personality and polish, offering players a more engaging and delightful experience from the very first screen.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 3, 2025: Dynamic Music and a Key Bug Fix]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Start Screen Parade and Visual Polish</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/24/start-screen-parade-visual-polish.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Start Screen Parade and Visual Polish" /><published>2025-05-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-05-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/24/start-screen-parade-visual-polish</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/24/start-screen-parade-visual-polish.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="may-24-2025-start-screen-parade-and-visual-polish">May 24, 2025: Start Screen Parade and Visual Polish</h1>

<p>Today’s update brings a burst of personality to Blob Race with a brand new animated start screen parade, along with several visual and code quality improvements.</p>

<h2 id="animated-blob-parade">Animated Blob Parade</h2>
<p>The most eye-catching addition is the animated blob parade on the start screen. Now, when you launch the game, a colorful procession of blobs marches endlessly across the screen, each with its own sprite, flip, and subtle vertical bob. To make the parade feel lively and unique every time, the code ensures that no two consecutive blobs share the same sprite, and each blob gets a random flip for extra variety.</p>

<p>The parade is implemented as a seamless loop: as blobs scroll off the left edge, they reappear on the right, creating a continuous, never-ending march. This was achieved by calculating the total parade length and drawing each blob a second time, offset by the full parade width, whenever it leaves the visible area. The result is a smooth, polished animation that sets the tone for the game.</p>

<h2 id="cleaner-initialization-logic">Cleaner Initialization Logic</h2>
<p>To support the new parade, the initialization code was refactored. Blob sprites are now chosen with care to avoid repetition, and the parade’s data structure is more robust. This not only improves the visual experience but also makes the code easier to extend for future features.</p>

<h2 id="visual-flare-and-polish">Visual Flare and Polish</h2>
<p>Alongside the parade, the start screen received additional visual tweaks, including improved color cycling and sprite handling. These changes make the game’s first impression more engaging and professional.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>With the start screen parade in place, Blob Race feels more alive and inviting. The groundwork is now set for further polish and new features that will continue to enhance the game’s charm and playability.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[May 24, 2025: Start Screen Parade and Visual Polish]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Moneyline Scoring and UI Improvements</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/23/moneyline-scoring-ui-improvements.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Moneyline Scoring and UI Improvements" /><published>2025-05-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-05-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/23/moneyline-scoring-ui-improvements</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025/05/23/moneyline-scoring-ui-improvements.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="may-23-2025-moneyline-scoring-and-ui-improvements">May 23, 2025: Moneyline Scoring and UI Improvements</h1>

<p>Today’s development session brought a major update to Blob Race’s scoring system and user interface, making the game’s risk/reward mechanics more transparent and engaging for players.</p>

<h2 id="moneyline-style-scoring">Moneyline-Style Scoring</h2>
<p>The biggest change was the implementation of a true moneyline-style scoring system, inspired by sports betting. Now, when you choose your blob, the game calculates a moneyline based on each blob’s probability of winning. If you pick the underdog (positive moneyline), you risk 100 points for a chance to win the moneyline value. If you pick the favorite (negative moneyline), you risk the absolute value of the moneyline for a chance to win 100 points. This change rewards bold choices and makes every race feel more strategic.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update_scoring</code> function was refactored to handle these scenarios, ensuring that both wins and losses are scored according to the selected blob’s moneyline. The logic is now much closer to real-world betting, and the code is easier to follow and maintain.</p>

<h2 id="ui-enhancements-clearer-risk-and-reward">UI Enhancements: Clearer Risk and Reward</h2>
<p>To help players make informed decisions, the UI in the blob selection screen now displays the exact risk and reward for each blob. The labels under each blob show the amount you risk and the potential reward, updating dynamically based on the calculated moneylines. This makes the game’s strategy more accessible and helps players understand the consequences of their choices.</p>

<h2 id="code-quality-and-documentation">Code Quality and Documentation</h2>
<p>Alongside these gameplay and UI changes, I added comments to key functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">win_probability_to_moneyline</code> to clarify the math behind the moneyline calculation. This should make future tweaks and maintenance much easier.</p>

<p>With these updates, Blob Race now offers a deeper, more transparent, and more rewarding experience for players who enjoy a bit of risk and strategy. Next up: more polish and maybe some new surprises for the racers!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[May 23, 2025: Moneyline Scoring and UI Improvements]]></summary></entry></feed>
