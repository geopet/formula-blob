<p>Today was a productive day as we introduced the boost mechanics and tackled several bugs to improve the overall gameplay experience.</p>

<p>The highlight of the day was the addition of a basic boost mechanic for players. This new feature allows players to temporarily increase their blob’s speed, adding an exciting layer of strategy to the game. Players now have to carefully decide the perfect moment to activate their boost, ensuring they maximize its impact during the race.</p>

<p>In addition to the boost mechanic, we focused on cleaning up the codebase by resolving various linting issues. This effort ensures that the code remains clean, maintainable, and easier to work with as the project grows. We also addressed issues with race logging, improving its accuracy and making it more helpful for both players and developers during gameplay.</p>

<p>Another significant task for the day was resolving rebase conflicts. These conflicts, while challenging, were successfully addressed, streamlining the development process and maintaining a consistent codebase. This step was crucial in keeping the project on track and ensuring smooth collaboration among team members.</p>

<p>Of course, the day was not without its challenges. Balancing the boost mechanic proved to be a delicate task, as we aimed to make it impactful without overpowering the gameplay. Debugging and resolving conflicts also required careful attention, but the team managed to overcome these hurdles while maintaining development momentum.</p>

<p>Blob Race is becoming more polished and exciting with each update. Tomorrow, we’ll focus on refining the overheat mechanics and adding more audio enhancements!</p>
