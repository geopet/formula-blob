# May 1, 2025: Race Mechanics and UI Enhancements

Today was a big day for Blob Race as we focused on the core race mechanics and improving the user interface.

The core race mechanics received significant attention, with logic added for blob movement and speed adjustments during the race. Variables were introduced to track race progress and determine the winner, ensuring a competitive and engaging experience for players. Balancing these mechanics to make the race fair and fun was a rewarding challenge.

On the UI front, we improved the race display to make it more engaging and informative. Telemetry gating was added to optimize performance, ensuring smooth gameplay even as the game becomes more complex. These enhancements make the interface not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.

Fine-tuning blob speeds was another important task, aimed at creating a balanced and competitive race experience. The dayâ€™s efforts have brought Blob Race closer to its vision of being a fun and dynamic racing game.

Blob Race is shaping up to be an exciting and competitive game. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand the gameplay!
