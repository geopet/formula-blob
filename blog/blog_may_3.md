# May 3, 2025: Refining the Gameplay

Today, we focused on refining the gameplay mechanics to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for players.

The day began with adjustments to the blob speeds. These tweaks were aimed at creating a balanced and competitive race, ensuring that no single blob had an unfair advantage. Improving the boost mechanics was another key task. The changes made boosts more intuitive and impactful, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.

In addition to gameplay adjustments, we addressed several minor bugs. These fixes improved the overall stability of the game, making it more reliable and polished for players. Balancing the gameplay mechanics to ensure they are both fun and fair was a challenging but rewarding process.
