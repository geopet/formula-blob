# June 10, 2025: Naming Update, Countdown Enhancements, Boost Animation, and More

The latest updates to Blob Race, now officially renamed to **Formula Blob**, bring a host of improvements, focusing on gameplay polish and visual excitement. Here's a breakdown of what's new:

## Countdown Enhancements

The countdown phase has been transformed into a more dynamic and engaging experience. Players will now encounter randomized false starts, adding an element of surprise and keeping them on their toes. To complement this, a new animation has been introduced, bringing visual excitement to the countdown sequence and setting the stage for the race ahead.

## Boost Animation and Refactor

The boost animation system has undergone a significant overhaul, enhancing both its visual clarity and maintainability. A brand-new boost animation injects energy into the racing experience, making every boost feel impactful. Behind the scenes, the code has been refactored to include a `draw_racer` helper function, streamlining the process of rendering racers. Additionally, per-blob state has been centralized into a single table, improving organization and paving the way for future enhancements.

## Audio Enhancements

The audio experience has also received attention, with new features designed to immerse players further into the world of Formula Blob. The addition of crowd and engine noise brings the racing environment to life, while the sharp squeal of tires during false starts provides immediate and satisfying feedback. These audio updates work in harmony with the visual improvements to create a more cohesive and engaging game.
