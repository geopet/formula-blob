### June 18, 2025: Formula Blob Gets a Naming Makeover and UI Polish!

The Formula Blob team has been busy refining the game, and we're excited to share the latest updates that bring more personality and polish to your blob-racing experience. Here's what's new:

#### **Blob Names: Meet Your Racers!**
Blobs now have unique, randomly generated names like "Blobzilla," "Max Verblobben," and "Blobo Norris." This feature adds a fun layer of personality to your racers, making each race feel more dynamic and engaging. No more generic "Blob 01" and "Blob 02"â€”your blobs now have character!

#### **UI Enhancements: Centered and Clean**
We've revamped the text layout across the game to improve readability and aesthetics. A new `print_centered` helper function ensures all text is perfectly aligned, from the welcome screen to the blob selection phase. Key updates include:
- Centered welcome messages and instructions.
- Cleaner name layouts for blobs during the selection phase.

#### **Code Refactors: DRY and Efficient**
To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, we've introduced:
- The `print_centered` function to eliminate repetitive text-centering logic.
- A `set_blob_names` function to handle unique name assignments for blobs.

#### **What's Next?**
With these updates, Formula Blob is more polished and fun than ever. We're already brainstorming the next set of features to make your blob-racing experience even better. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy racing!
