# April 28, 2025: The Beginning of Blob Race

Today marks the start of Blob Race! We laid the foundation for the game by setting up the core mechanics and creating the first visual elements.

The day began with the implementation of a basic state machine. This system is designed to manage the different phases of the game, serving as the backbone for all future gameplay features. It was a challenging task to design a state machine that is flexible enough to accommodate future features, but the effort was well worth it.

On the visual side, we created the first set of blob sprites. These sprites give the game its initial visual identity, striking a balance between simplicity and distinctiveness. Designing these sprites was a creative challenge, but it was exciting to see the blobs come to life on the screen.

Blob Race is off to a great start. Tomorrow, weâ€™ll focus on adding more interactivity and refining the visuals!
