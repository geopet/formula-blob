# May 9, 2025: Refinements and Boost Enhancements

Today was a productive day for Blob Race, as we focused on refining the codebase and enhancing the boost mechanics for both players and opponents. The gameplay has become more dynamic and engaging, thanks to these updates.

One of the most exciting changes was the introduction of more variation in the opponent's boost logic. This improvement makes the race more unpredictable and thrilling, keeping players on their toes. To give the opponent a little more thoughtfulness, we also implemented a cooldown check for their boosts, striking a balance between challenge and interesting playability.

Behind the scenes, the codebase underwent significant refinements. Global variables were consolidated into the `_init()` function, creating a more organized and maintainable structure. The player boost variables were converted into a table, making the code modular and easier to manage. Additionally, we cleaned up and renamed variables related to opponent boosts, enhancing clarity and readability.

These updates not only improve the gameplay experience but also set the stage for future development. Blob Race is steadily evolving into a polished and exciting game. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand the project!
