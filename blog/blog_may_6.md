# May 6, 2025: Audio Enhancements and Overheat Improvements

Today was all about making Blob Race more immersive and engaging. We focused on audio enhancements and refining the overheat mechanics to add depth to the gameplay.

New sound effects were created for boosts and overheat events, making the game more dynamic and providing immediate feedback to the player. The boost sound effects convey a sense of speed and excitement, while the overheat sounds add tension, enhancing the overall experience.

The overheat timer logic was refined to ensure it resets correctly and behaves as expected. This improvement makes the overheat mechanics more predictable and fair, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay. Designing sound effects that enhance the gameplay without becoming repetitive or annoying was a creative challenge, but the results are highly satisfying.

Various bugs were also squashed, and the codebase was cleaned up to improve readability and maintainability. These efforts ensure that Blob Race continues to evolve into a polished and engaging game.

Blob Race is becoming more polished and exciting with each passing day. Tomorrow, weâ€™ll dive into opponent boosts and other gameplay enhancements!
