# April 30, 2025: Countdown and Logging Improvements

Today, we focused on refining the countdown mechanics and improving the logging system to make Blob Race more polished and developer-friendly.

The addition of a countdown feature was a major highlight. This new mechanic builds anticipation before the race starts, adding a layer of excitement for players. To ensure the countdown is both dynamic and engaging, we refactored the countdown messenger for better readability and maintainability.

On the development side, we introduced a helper function for logging. This improvement makes it easier to track game states and debug issues, streamlining the development process. Designing a logging system that is both informative and unobtrusive was a challenge, but the result is a more efficient and developer-friendly tool.

Blob Race is steadily improving with each update. Tomorrow, weâ€™ll dive into race mechanics and UI enhancements!
