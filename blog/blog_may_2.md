# May 2, 2025: Polishing and Documentation

Today was all about refining the game and setting up tools to ensure a smooth development process moving forward.

One of the key tasks was creating a detailed changelog. This document tracks the progress of Blob Race, providing a clear record of the features added in each update. It’s a valuable resource for both developers and players, offering insights into the game’s evolution.

We also integrated Pico-8 linting tools to maintain a clean and error-free codebase. This step ensures that the code adheres to best practices, making it easier to maintain and build upon. Setting up these tools and ensuring they work seamlessly with the existing codebase was a meticulous but worthwhile effort.

Finally, we updated the version number to reflect the progress made so far. These updates make Blob Race better documented and more maintainable than ever. Next, we’ll dive into adding more gameplay features and refining the race mechanics!
